## Overview
    
### Description
Push Fit is an app that provides a simple and clean interface to build your workout routines. The app has a variety of exercises to choose from whether you have access to weights, machines or just your body.


### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Fitness & Health
- **Mobile:** This type of application wouldn't be as useful if solely implemented on a desktop. A desktop version of this app would simply be used to save workouts to be viewed 
- **Story:** Presents users with an array of choices to build their workouts according to their needs.
- **Market:** Anyone leading or seeking an active lifestyle. Ability to save workout routines to be reused later
- **Habit:** The app can be quickly accessed whenever the user needs it. The ability to save routines can help schedule out workout days, incorporating the app in their daily routine.
- **Scope:** Initially this will be focused on simply picking and choosing exercises and manually building a workout routine. This concept can be further developed by automatically generating/suggesting routines based on muscle groups or equipment. Further additions could include a social aspect to share workouts and browse other people's routines.
